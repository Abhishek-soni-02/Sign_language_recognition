# Sign_language_recognition
This project is a deep learning-based Sign Language Recognition System that detects American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is trained on the publicly available Sign Language MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of hand signs representing 24 English alphabets (Aâ€“Y, excluding J and Z).
